# Visualization---University-Ranking
Find new insights with Times Higher Education data across the years. Made an interactive dashboard with D3 to get these insights.

Here are some beautifful kaggle links I had found on the go which you can use in future to do further analysis.
* Data is from here : https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings
* Basic idea is from here :  http://www.kinshuk.co/projects/univiz.html </br>
                             http://www.faygu.com/info-viz/d3
* D3 correlogram, probably add this to the dashboard in future.
* Other interesting python notebooks and visualizations on this or similar dataset

<b>LESSONS LEARNT:</b>
* Always plan your UI and have a higher level design(what analysis to show) fixed in your mind which shouldn't change in future.
* <b>Coorelation factors</b> are very important in any data anlysis. It gives a quick overview of your dataset and gives wonderful analysis results. Check [my fav] link above.
